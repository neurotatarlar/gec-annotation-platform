› Good. Currently the text can be submitted and trash/skipped. I want to be has only one exclusive state. So if we mark skip text and then return to the
  text again we can make changes and submit it. After that I expect it marked as submitted and not skipped or trashed anymore. Same thing with trashing/
  skipping already submitted texts - it should have only lastest state and should have one of exclusive states: skipped/trashed/submitted
 revert all also remove submit state
